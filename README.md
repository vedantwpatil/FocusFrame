# Screen Capture

This program captures screen recording and will be able to add high quality smooth zoom animations on click as well as record high quality video

## Project Timeline

Able to take screen recordings through taking multiple screenshots per second and then encoding them all together using ffmpeg. Was unable to capture more than (First iteration) 5FPS (Second Iteration) 7 FPS and looking at alternative methods to increase frame rate utilizing the screenshots package.

Now we've switched over to using ffmpeg to capture the screen and encode the captured video and getting higher frame rate.

#### Current Status

Working on mouse tracking and interactions for video transitions and editing
